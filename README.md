YouTube-Data-Harvesting-And-Warehousing 
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project that intends to provide users with the ability to access and analyse data from numerous YouTube channels. SQL, Pandas, and Stream lit, are used in the project to develop a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, save, and query YouTube channel and video data.
TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED: 
This project requires the following components:
STREAMLIT: Stream lit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.
PYTHON: Python programming language being easy to learn and understand. Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development and for complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.
GOOGLE API CLIENT: The googleapiclient library in Python facilitates the communication with different Google APIs. Its primary purpose in this project is to interact with YouTube's Data API v3, allowing the retrieval of essential information like channel details, video specifics, and comments. By utilizing googleapiclient, developers can easily access and manipulate YouTube's extensive data resources through code.
PANDAS: Pandas is used for storing data into data frame which enable the user for easy transformation of data to SQL,Pandas are used to store the data which is fetched from Python.
MY-SQL:MY SQL is an open-source and highly scalable database management system (DBMS) known for its reliability and extensive features. It provides a platform for storing and managing structured data, offering support for various data types SQL capabilities.
FEATURES: The following functions are available in the YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing application: Retrieval of channel and video data from YouTube using the YouTube API.
Storage of data in a MY-SQL database.
Migration of data from the Data frame to a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
Search and retrieval of data from the SQL database using different search options.

Results:

This Webpage is developed in such a way that user can easily retrieve the details of YouTube channel by entering their respective channel ids.
